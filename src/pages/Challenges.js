          Scrimba is an innovative programming learning platform, incorporating a live code editor
          where you can take over from the instructor and seamlessly make alterations at any time.
          No need to download project files, install dependencies, or setup bundlers, just open up a
          lesson and edit the code directly in place. The skills used in building this site were
          acquired whilst following their ReactJS courses, so I really suggest giving them a try. If
          you need any help, or just want a chat, you can always find me on their community

          Challenge descriptions have been pulled directly from screencasts on Scrimba. I have also
          included links to the relevant &quot;Scrims&quot;, where you can edit and play with my
          solutions directly.
